# Sponsor OSS!

You probably came to this page because one of our gems dropped an edge-feature and raised an exception.

This is annoying, and we know how you feel now.

These words come from an OSS author who's been giving out free software, free support, free passion, time and money for a decade. OSS is a great thing, but those who benefit the most from it - _you_ - often do not consider giving back anything but bug reports.

And this is not only annoying for us, but can ruin a career. Not every OSS author is backed by a global player company or drives racing cars over the weekend, just for fun.

We need to work like everyone else. We have dayjobs, family, friends, and all that other time-consuming stuff. We simply can't spend our free time on a feature we don't even use personally.

If you really need a feature, please pay for it and we will make your support public and will be friends forever.



not giving back is like using torrent without uploading - it kills the idea.
