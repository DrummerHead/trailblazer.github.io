## Caching

Cells allow you to cache per state. It's simple: the rendered result of a state method is cached and expired as you configure it.

To cache forever, don't configure anything

```ruby
class CartCell < Cell::Rails
  cache :show

  def show
    render
  end
```

This will run `#show` only once, after that the rendered view comes from the cache.


### Cache Options

Note that you can pass arbitrary options through to your cache store. Symbols are evaluated as instance methods, callable objects (e.g. lambdas) are evaluated in the cell instance context allowing you to call instance methods and access instance variables. All arguments passed to your state (e.g. via `render_cell`) are propagated to the block.

```ruby
cache :show, :expires_in => 10.minutes
```

If you need dynamic options evaluated at render-time, use a lambda.

```ruby
cache :show, :tags => lambda { |*args| tags }
```

If you don't like blocks, use instance methods instead.

```ruby
class CartCell < Cell::Rails
  cache :show, :tags => :cache_tags

  def cache_tags(*args)
    # do your magic..
  end
```

### Conditional Caching

The +:if+ option lets you define a condition. If it doesn't return a true value, caching for that state is skipped.

```ruby
cache :show, :if => lambda { |*| has_changed? }
```

### Cache Keys

You can expand the state's cache key by appending a versioner block to the `::cache` call. This way you can expire state caches yourself.

```ruby
class CartCell < Cell::Rails
  cache :show do |options|
    order.id
  end
```

The versioner block is executed in the cell instance context, allowing you to access all stakeholder objects you need to compute a cache key. The return value is appended to the state key: `"cells/cart/show/1"`.

As everywhere in Rails, you can also return an array.

```ruby
class CartCell < Cell::Rails
  cache :show do |options|
    [id, options[:items].md5]
  end
```

Resulting in: `"cells/cart/show/1/0ecb1360644ce665a4ef"`.


### Debugging Cache

When caching is turned on, you might wanna see notifications. Just like a controller, Cells gives you the following notifications.

* `write_fragment.action_controller` for cache miss.
* `read_fragment.action_controller` for cache hits.

To activate notifications, include the `Notifications` module in your cell.

```ruby
class Comment::Cell < Cell::Rails
  include Cell::Caching::Notifications
```

### Inheritance

Cache configuration is inherited to derived cells.




### Testing Caching

If you want to test it in `development`, you need to put `config.action_controller.perform_caching = true` in `development.rb` to see the effect.
