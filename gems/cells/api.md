### Call

The `#call` method also accepts a block and yields `self` (the cell instance) to it. This is extremely helpful for using `content_for` outside of the cell.

```ruby
  = cell(:song, Song.last).call(:show) do |cell|
    content_for :footer, cell.footer
```

Note how the block is run in the global view's context, allowing you to use global helpers like `content_for`.
