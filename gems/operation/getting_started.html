<p>internal state like @params, but without a chance to mess it up (can’t instantiate it)</p>

<p>i don’t want you to instantiate an operatoin without runnin because it will end up like an AR “container”</p>

<p>maybe think about operations the other way round: ask yourself what processing needs to happen when you browse to page of your app, or when you trigger a function like “follow user”. that’s the operation. the presentation of the result is a completely different story</p>

<p>don’t confuse the operation with a UI specific thing like a calendar -&gt; edit day</p>

<h2 id="whats-a-concept">What’s A Concept?</h2>
<p>calendar/
  day.rb # domain object/poro/twin
  month.rb
  stat.rb
  cell/
      month.rb
      week_row.rb
  views/
      month.slim
  edit_day.rb # operation</p>

<p>again, this is simply me thinking aloud. but i guess it’s better to start of with a concept too big and then refine it instead of going the other way when you don’t know your domain, yet.</p>

<h2 id="validation">Validation</h2>

<p>Just because validations now sit in the operation (or better: the form object) doesn’t mean you can’t use the model, for instance, to perform a uniquness validation. The opposite is the case: You may cleanly wrap the check and write in a table lock for a <em>real</em> uniqueness validation in one atomic step.</p>
