<p>Design</p>

<p>Load deeper structured files, first. representer, policy etc should not depend on each other</p>

<h2 id="first-step" data-magellan-target="first-step">First Step</h2>

<p>If automatic loading doesnâ€™t work for you, as a first resolution, require files manually.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge">
<pre class="highlight"><code>require_relative "../comment/create"
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Actually, Ruby is the only programming language that does help with loading, and has problems. Most other languages require you to load files manually.</p>

<p>Even Matz himself is <a href="https://twitter.com/yukihiro_matz/status/676170870226706432">not so sure anymore</a> if allowing autoloading was a wise choice in Ruby.</p>
