      At some point of time we started to decouple our form objects from models. Things got a lot easier when we found out there is a ready to use solution which solves our exact problem. That was Reform. Soon after, we started using all other parts of Trailblazer and haven't regretted a second of our time we spent using it.

      Trailblazer helps organize my code, the book showed me how. You can assume what each component does by its name, it's very easy and intuitive, it should be shipped as an essential part of Rails.
